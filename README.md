**Project Overview**
This project implements a Face Detection and Recognition System that utilizes advanced techniques such as Machine Learning, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate face detection and recognition. The system is designed to classify image segments as either face or non-face (background), making it suitable for applications in security, attendance management, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.

**Features**
Face Detection: Detects human faces in images and video streams by classifying regions as face or non-face.

Face Recognition: Recognizes known faces based on a pre-trained dataset.

Accuracy Enhancement: Achieves high accuracy by training on a variety of angles, facial expressions, and lighting conditions.

Attendance System: An automatic student attendance system based on facial recognition, designed to replace manual attendance processes.

Deep Learning Model: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for improved detection and recognition performance.
