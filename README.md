# **Face Detection & Recognition System**

## **Project Overview**

This project implements a **Face Detection and Recognition System** that utilizes advanced techniques such as **Machine Learning**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **Local Binary Pattern (LBP)**, and **Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for accurate face detection and recognition. The system is designed to classify image segments as either face or non-face (background), making it suitable for applications in **security**, **attendance management**, **surveillance**, and **human-computer interaction**.

## **Features**

- **Face Detection**: Detects human faces in images and video streams by classifying regions as face or non-face.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes known faces based on a pre-trained dataset.
- **Accuracy Enhancement**: Achieves high accuracy by training on a variety of angles, facial expressions, and lighting conditions.
- **Attendance System**: An automatic student attendance system based on facial recognition, designed to replace manual attendance processes.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for improved detection and recognition performance.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The main programming language used for implementing the face detection and recognition algorithms.
- **OpenCV**: Open Source Computer Vision Library used for real-time image processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for feature extraction.
- **Dlib**: A toolkit for machine learning used for facial landmark detection and face recognition.
- **NumPy**: A library used for handling data arrays and matrix operations.
